# banking_deposit_prediction

### How to Use:

    There will be a UI, which upon entering the i/p will predict whether this customer will subscribe to Term deposit or not.
    
    Currently -
    a) the UI is done, but it just saves the i/p as csv file
    b) Model is trained, metrics are calculated, testing is pending
    
    Next and final task:
    Adding button which test i/p with model data

## Issue/Future Scope:

    - No Validation check of any kind, so user can enter
        a) empty value
        b) dirty value
      without any error
    
    - Application doesn't auto quit
